          PVic Games was founded in July, 2023 with the release of Ednaldo
          Pereira: Mobile. Created by art school dropout Pedro Victor 'Pvic'
          Gon√ßalves, a veteran in the Sonic community and later, the key
          gameplay programmer for Antonblast -- one of the most widely
          celebrated indie games in recent times -- PVic Games' founding ideals
          are simple: make high quality, artistic games that transcend our
          simplistic ideals of imagination and creativity and take us to another
          place. 'Pure Imagination' is more than a tagline, it's where our
          hearts are.
          
        </p>
        <p className="mt-10 font-helvetica font-bold">
          The journey has just begun, and we invite you to step into our world
          of creative silence -- where imagination is the ultimate refuge of
          freedom.
